# Pion Community Participation Guidelines

These guidelines aim to support a community where all people should feel safe to participate, introduce new ideas and
inspire others, regardless of:

* Background
* Family status
* Gender
* Gender identity or expression
* Marital or relationship status
* Sex
* Sexual orientation
* Native language
* Age
* Ability
* Race and/or ethnicity
* Caste
* National origin
* Socioeconomic status
* Religion
* Geographic location
* Any other dimension of diversity

Openness, collaboration and participation are core aspects of our work — from development on Pion to collaboratively
designing curriculum. We gain strength from diversity and actively seek participation from those who enhance it. These
guidelines exist to enable diverse individuals and groups to interact and collaborate to mutual advantage. This document
outlines both expected and prohibited behavior.

## When and How to Use These Guidelines

These guidelines outline our behavior expectations as members of the Pion community in all Pion activities, both
offline and online. Your participation is contingent upon following these guidelines in all Pion activities,
including but not limited to:

* Working in Pion spaces.
* Working with other Pion community participants virtually or co-located.
* Representing Pion at public events.
* Representing Pion in social media (official accounts, staff accounts, personal accounts, social media pages).
* Participating in Pion offsites and trainings.
* Participating in Pion-related forums, mailing lists, wikis, websites, chat channels, bugs, group or
  person-to-person meetings, and Pion-related correspondence.

While these guidelines/code of conduct are specifically aimed at Pion’s work and community, we recognize that it is
possible for actions taken outside of Pion’s online or in person spaces to have a deep impact on community health. This
is an active topic in the diversity and inclusion realm. We anticipate wide-ranging discussions among our communities
about appropriate boundaries.

## Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected of all Pion community participants:

### Be Respectful

Value each other’s ideas, styles and viewpoints. We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor
manners. Be open to different possibilities and to being wrong. Be respectful in all interactions and communications,
especially when debating the merits of different options. Be aware of your impact and how intense interactions may be
affecting people. Be direct, constructive and positive. Take responsibility for your impact and your mistakes – if
someone says they have been harmed through your words or actions, listen carefully, apologize sincerely, and correct the
behavior going forward.

### Be Direct but Professional

We are likely to have some discussions about if and when criticism is respectful and when it’s not. We *must* be able to
speak directly when we disagree and when we think we need to improve. We cannot withhold hard truths. Doing so
respectfully is hard, doing so when others don’t seem to be listening is harder, and hearing such comments when one is
the recipient can be even harder still. We need to be honest and direct, as well as respectful.

### Be Inclusive

Seek diverse perspectives. Diversity of views and of people on teams powers innovation, even if it is not always
comfortable. Encourage all voices. Help new perspectives be heard and listen actively. If you find yourself dominating a
discussion, it is especially important to step back and encourage other voices to join in. Be aware of how much time is
taken up by dominant members of the group. Provide alternative ways to contribute or participate when possible.

Be inclusive of everyone in an interaction, respecting and facilitating people’s participation whether they are:

* Remote (on video or phone)
* Not native language speakers
* Coming from a different culture
* Using pronouns other than “he” or “she”
* Living in a different time zone
* Facing other challenges to participate

Think about how you might facilitate alternative ways to contribute or participate. If you find yourself dominating a
discussion, step back. Make way for other voices and listen actively to them.

### Understand Different Perspectives

Our goal should not be to “win” every disagreement or argument. A more productive goal is to be open to ideas that make
our own ideas better. Strive to be an example for inclusive thinking. “Winning” is when different perspectives make our
work richer and stronger.

### Appreciate and Accommodate Our Similarities and Differences

Pion community participants come from many cultures and backgrounds. Cultural differences can encompass everything from
official religious observances to personal habits to clothing. Be respectful of people with different cultural
practices, attitudes and beliefs. Work to eliminate your own biases, prejudices and discriminatory practices. Think of
others’ needs from their point of view. Use preferred titles (including pronouns) and the appropriate tone of voice.
Respect people’s right to privacy and confidentiality. Be open to learning from and educating others as well as
educating yourself; it is unrealistic to expect Pion community participants to know the cultural practices of every
ethnic and cultural group, but everyone needs to recognize one’s native culture is only part of positive interactions.

### Lead by Example

By matching your actions with your words, you become a person others want to follow. Your actions influence others to
behave and respond in ways that are valuable and appropriate for our organizational outcomes. Design your community and
your work for inclusion. Hold yourself and others accountable for inclusive behaviors. Make decisions based on the
highest good.

## Behavior That Will Not Be Tolerated

The following behaviors are considered to be unacceptable under these guidelines.

### Violence and Threats of Violence

Violence and threats of violence are not acceptable - online or offline. This includes incitement of violence toward any
individual, including encouraging a person to commit self-harm. This also includes posting or threatening to post other
people’s personally identifying information (“doxxing”) online.

### Personal Attacks

Conflicts will inevitably arise, but frustration should never turn into a personal attack. It is not okay to insult,
demean or belittle others. Attacking someone for their opinions, beliefs and ideas is not acceptable. It is important to
speak directly when we disagree and when we think we need to improve, but such discussions must be conducted
respectfully and professionally, remaining focused on the issue at hand.

### Derogatory Language

Hurtful or harmful language related to:

* Background
* Family status
* Gender
* Gender identity or expression
* Marital or relationship status
* Sex
* Sexual orientation
* Native language
* Age
* Ability
* Race and/or ethnicity
* Caste
* National origin
* Socioeconomic status
* Religion
* Geographic location
* Other attributes

is not acceptable. This includes deliberately referring to someone by a gender that they do not identify with, and/or
questioning the legitimacy of an individual’s gender identity. If you’re unsure if a word is derogatory, don’t use it.
This also includes repeated subtle and/or indirect discrimination; when asked to stop, stop the behavior in question.

### Unwelcome Sexual Attention or Physical Contact

Unwelcome sexual attention or unwelcome physical contact is not acceptable. This includes sexualized comments, jokes or
imagery in interactions, communications or presentation materials, as well as inappropriate touching, groping, or sexual
advances. Additionally, touching a person without permission, including sensitive areas such as their hair, pregnant
stomach, mobility device (wheelchair, scooter, etc) or tattoos is unacceptable. This includes physically blocking or
intimidating another person. Physical contact or simulated physical contact (such as emojis like “kiss”) without
affirmative consent is not acceptable. The sharing or distribution of sexualized images or text is unacceptable.

### Disruptive Behavior

Sustained disruption of events, forums, or meetings, including talks and presentations, will not be tolerated. This
includes:

* ‘Talking over’ or ‘heckling’ speakers.
* Drinking alcohol to excess or using recreational drugs to excess, or pushing others to do so.
* Making derogatory comments about those who abstain from alcohol or other substances, pushing people to drink, talking
  about their abstinence or preferences to others, or pressuring them to drink - physically or through jeering.
* Otherwise influencing crowd actions that cause hostility in the session.

### Influencing Unacceptable Behavior

We will treat influencing or leading such activities the same way we treat the activities themselves, and thus the same
consequences apply.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Bad behavior from any Pion community participant, including those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.
Intentional efforts to exclude people (except as part of a consequence of the guidelines or other official action) from
Mozilla activities are not acceptable and will be dealt with appropriately.

Reports of harassment/discrimination will be promptly and thoroughly investigated by the people responsible for the
safety of the space, event or activity. Appropriate measures will be taken to address the situation.

Anyone being asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. Violation of these guidelines can
result in anyone being asked to leave an event or online space, either temporarily or for the duration of the event, or
being banned from participation in spaces, or future events and activities in perpetuity.

In addition, any participants who abuse the reporting process will be considered to be in violation of these guidelines
and subject to the same consequences. False reporting, especially to retaliate or exclude, will not be accepted or
tolerated.

## Reporting

If you believe you’re experiencing unacceptable behavior that will not be tolerated as outlined above, please use
coc-report@pionframework.io to report.

After receiving a concise description of your situation, they will review and determine the next steps. In addition to
conducting any investigation, they can provide a range of resources, from a private consultation to other community
resources. They will involve other colleagues or outside specialists (such as legal counsel), as needed to appropriately
address each situation.

Please also report to us if you observe a potentially dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of these
guidelines, even if the situation is not happening to you.

If you feel you have been unfairly accused of violating these guidelines, please follow the same reporting process.

appropriate in a particular case. Your agreement to comply with the guidelines will be deemed agreement to any changes
to it.
